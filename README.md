# sato-automotive-engineering-club.github.io
Website for Sato's Automotive Engineering Club! [DEPRECATED]

## About us
We are a club founded in 2022 at Sato Academy of Mathematics and Science. Our projects range from remote control scale model vehicles to competition winning go-karts. For more information look at the website `satoautomotive.org`!

## How to contribute
Members of the club looking to contribute to the website should learn HTML and/or CSS. The code for the site is pretty well documented, so there shouldn't be much trouble there. Before making commits to the repository, contact Mr. Perez or Connor De Leo (c/o 2024) and check changes with other club officers via vote.

## Deprecation
Due to me (Connor De Leo) being a c/o 2024 student in my last year, and lack of other members with programming knowledge, site is being moved from GitHub Pages and HTML code to Google Sites and their proprietary (codeless) web editor. This repository will stay up (alongside the old site's code) in case there is a need for code storage in the future, although the index page will be pushed behind `/deprecated`.
